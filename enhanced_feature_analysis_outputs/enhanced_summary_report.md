- Inquiry Call Type Law Type (Broad) = 'MVA'

## Dataset Overview

- **Total records:** 1,200
- **Total features:** 60
- **Target variable:** MVA_Qualified
- **Positive cases (MVA Qualified):** 1,200 (100.00%)
- **Negative cases:** 0 (0.00%)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Exclude 19 Tier 1 features** - These have clear data leakage or PII risks
2. **Review 18 Tier 2 features** - Domain expert review required
3. **Start modeling with 23 Tier 4 features** - These appear safest

### Feature Selection Strategy

1. Begin with Tier 4 features only for baseline model
2. Gradually add reviewed Tier 3 features if needed
3. Only include Tier 2 features after thorough validation
4. Never include Tier 1 features

### Model Development Considerations

- The composite target captures MVA-specific qualification patterns
- Consider building separate models for other law types if needed
- Monitor for class imbalance given the low positive rate
- Use stratified sampling to maintain target distribution

### Risk Mitigation

- Validate temporal integrity (no future information)
- Check for indirect target leakage
- Consider feature engineering from safe features only
- Monitor model performance for signs of overfitting
- Implement cross-validation to ensure generalization
